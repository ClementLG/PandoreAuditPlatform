## _Features_

- Capture traffic from any network interface
- Viewing the results in a GUI (web) :

  - Servers reached (ip, DNS name and associated company)
  - A score on captured traffic (**to be determined**)
  - A focus on unwanted, unnecessary traffic 
- Export results (JSON or other)

##  _Tech_

Pandore uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - An efficient programming language for data processing.
- [Pyshark](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark) - Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) - MariaDB is a community-developed relational database management system.
